# HarmonicGBCs
HarmonicGBC map is a bijective map from a polygon to a convex polygon
In paper "On the Bijectivity of Harmonic Function Map with 
Application to Image Deformation" by T. Hu, C. Deng, and M.-J. Lai, we use the harmonic GBCs function to establish the bijectivity of the 
map constructed by using these harmonic GBC functions when maping from a polygon to a convex polygon. In addition, we combine two of these
maps to form a bijective map from any polygon to any polygon. We use bivariate spline functions to approximate the harmonic GBC functions.
We use them for image deformation. Two applications are presented. One is to do medical image deformation so that we can generate a lot of
artificial, but labeled images for training of a neural network. Another one is to do image warping for artworks.  

There are two demo codes. Please read and run them to see the desired results.
